Life without feasts and celebrations is charm less and lifeless. So is true in case of college life. Without functions and celebrations college life becomes monotonous and uninteresting. Therefore, almost all the colleges have certain annual functions such as, Annual Sports Day, Parents' Day, Teachers' Day, College Anniversary Day, etc. These celebrations add colour and charm to college life. Celebrated annually to commemorate the foundation day of the Institute. The day is celebrated at the close of the academic session. It provides an opportunity to assess the achievements and shortfalls. The students are actively associated in all the segments of the programme. Rather, they manage all the activities by themselves. The presentation of annual report of college activities is a special feature of the annual day function. Felicitation and distribution of certificates of merit in due acknowledgement to the students, faculty and staff of the college for their exemplary performance in different academic pursuits forms another segment of the programme. Various cultural programmes are organized by the students of SVIT-Vasad. © 2018 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Technology, Vasad. All Rights Reserved.

The events were kicked off with the inauguration by the Head of the Department and the ISTE coordinator of each department. The events started by 10 am and got over by 3.30 PM With a plethora of events ranging from basic technical knowledge to the tasking non-technical events and not to forget the On the Spot events and the breath taking flash mob performed by each department the entire day was fun-filled and joyful. Taking into consideration the engineering background and interest of innovative and young minds the events were well framed as to not just sharpen the minds of the students but also to make them ready for the future which lies ahead. The day ended with everyone dancing to the melodious tunes of Garba and some peppy songs.
